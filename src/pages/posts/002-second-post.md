"If you want something you've never had, you have to do something you've never done". If you want real change in your life, you've got to get uncomfortable. Just like working out, change hurts. It's not going to be fun, and you're not going to like it. But the greatest people will not be content with the status quo and get uncomfortable - they'll do something they've never done before. I have left many opportunities wasted in my life, but I am gradually becoming more and more courageous. I hope I have inspired you to do one more courageous thing today that you wouldn't have done before reading this.
