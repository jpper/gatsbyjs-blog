July is almost over! Wow, this year has been flying by.

I think our app is finally in the end stages of development and looking likely
to release next month, so I'm getting excited to have something finally going
out to production. It probably could have gotten out even sooner, had I been
focusing more on just that, but the last couple months have been full of a
lot of first PHP and then Laravel training, so I haven't been focusing on
app development as much. I think it's really cool to have experience with server-side
administration though, and I'm sure that will be quite useful going forward
in my career.

Apart from that, I've been able to stay really connected with helping lay
foundations for Hillsong, and I hope we'll be able to start meeting in person
again soon!

Have an awesome end of July!

Jonathan
