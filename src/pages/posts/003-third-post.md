I know, I know. That new technology seems sooo cool, right?? You've just got to learn React, Vue, Gatsby.js, cloud functions, the list goes on. But you've got to try to resist that urge.

But just like actually going on that run, I seldom buckle down to a specific technology long enough to 
become an expert. But once you finally take the time to get really familiar with one thing, you might 
finally become proficient enough in it to make something meaningful and useful. For example, I've
recently been going through every single tutorial on freecodecamp's Youtube channel. And while I've
been able to make a lot of cool things, I don't feel that I'm specializing enough, and learning any
single technology deeply enough to really break into the kind of job that I want.

I feel that more than ever, I'm being drawn to web application development, and being able to create
something like this blog here is already more than I even imagined I'd be able to do. But in order
to start a business, I need to think of something new and profitable. In order to do that, I need
to provide a service that people are going to want to use. My tentative plan is to continue to get
more proficient with Angular, and build some kind of app on that framework.
