I know, I know. That new technology seems sooo cool, right?? You've just got to learn React, Vue, Gatsby.js, cloud functions, the list goes on. But you've got to try to resist that urge.

But just like actually going on that run, I seldom buckle down to a specific technology long enough to become an expert. But once you finally take the time to get really familiar with one thing, you might finally become proficient enough in it to make something meaningful and useful.
