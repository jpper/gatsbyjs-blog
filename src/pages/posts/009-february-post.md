February is almost over, but things are moving and I've got some goals going
forward and moving in the right direction so my year's off to a great start!

Last weekend I finally got the change to go snowboarding in Japan, which I
have had a rough goal of doing for quite a while now, so that was awesome.
My very first run was ridiculously rough as it was basically learning all
over again from the start, if I had even ever really been "able to snowboard".
But I got better throughout the day, but injured myself minorly from all
the falling.

Apart from that, I have been reading more books as well and possibly my
favorite so far this year was "Sphere" by Michael Crichton; I really
liked that the sphere is kind of a symbol for the power of thinking
and the effect that we can have on others through our thinking. It made
me want to try to focus more on the happiness of others and try to
be less selfish in my thinking and in life.

My project at work seems to be going okay; I really hope for a late-March
release or so, and that I'll be able to start gaining new additional skills
at that time. My Japanese has also been improving quickly, and I will plan
to shoot again for 二級 this July, which I have a great feeling I will
pass with flying colors. Wish I had more time for some more side projects,
but I will likely finish a media capturing side project, release to Google
Play, and link to it within my next couple of posts as well.

Have an awesome end of February!
