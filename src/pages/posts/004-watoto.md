This last Sunday, a group of children from Watoto Church in Kampala, Uganda came to sing and dance
at our church. Their singing was nice and their dancing incredible, but the most memorable part of
the experience to me was the kids' joy. I can't forget that without a pause, the kids did not stop
grinning all day long. These kids are in some of the harshest circumstances imaginable, and yet
they have this joy from God that goes beyond any I've ever seen.

I also had the privilege to high-five each of the kids, and it was an amazing experience. I went early
to help set up the speakers, so I didn't stay all the way through all of the services
(which were the same), but I left changed and with a new perspective on life.
