Wow, I can't believe how quickly yet another month has flown by. I'd better start posting a little more often. Well it's Hacktober this month, and I barely even delved into a single open-source project outside of my main job. And I think open-source software is extemely important, so even with Digital Ocean's campaign to win a free t-shirt, it still wasn't enough to get me as productive as I'd like to be on that front.

But I did look at a couple of projects, and in particular one of the most interesting ones was a project a friend brought up at a recent tech talk, called Golden Cheetah. I'd be interested in at least checking it out, and using it at some point, especially if I'm able to contribute to it.

There's not a lot of substance to this post, but the main thing I'd love to hear is if there are any interested open-source projects you've worked on or contributed to this month. Please let me know if so, and what you find interesting about the project! Hope to see you back here in the future and share more about what I will have checked out or contributed to in the future. Happy Halloween, Happy Hacking!

The teaching about the cross seems foolish to those who are on their way to destruction. But to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
