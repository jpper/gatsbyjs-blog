Can you believe 2019 is almost over!? I just wanted to give a quick update post on recent events
before the clock strikes midnight!

I started a new job last Monday, and it's been both interesting and very exciting. Basically, the
company is running as a video game shop but we're also developing a website and mobile app providing
a service to our customer. From the first day I have been assigned to develop the UI for a mobile 
application, and since I am very comfortable with Ionic Framwork as I used it considerably in my last 
job, they had me go ahead and port their existing design to Ionic. I've had a couple of hangups in 
reproducing a barcode and a couple other UI elements that they wanted strict adherence to given the previous 
app and it was pretty hard for me to get jQuery running on Ionic, but I have been able to workaround so far.

Most of all, I think it's pretty exciting to finally be working full-time at a Japanese company, and 
have an insight into what it's like to really be working at a traditional-style company. There is definitely 
a significant language barrier, but I am determined to fight through and be both successful at the company 
but also of course to produce a product that will make them happy to have hired me.

Nothing really too exciting has happened in my personal life lately, but tonight I decided to check out 
Code Chrysalis's monthly Algorithms Meetup again. It was good to have a chance to work through a few
algorithms problems in my head, and hear some solutions, since those are never going to go away as long as I 
am in the software engineering field, and I really don't plan to leave at any point. The days are pretty much 
flying by as I really like mobile app development, so I am as sure as ever that I'm in the right industry.

I would like to incorporate more writing into my career in the future as well, and I wish I had been making 
a bit more progress on my book, but I will certainly hope to put in some solid work into that over this 
holiday break. I am mostly just glad that my company has approved my request, and that I'll be able to get 
plugged right back into it once I arrive back from the States on 6 January. I'll probably get around to 
writing one more post before that time as well, but if I don't, take care, stay warm (especially if you're 
unfortunate and have to stick out the whole winter in Michigan xD), and I hope to see you back here or in 
any of my other side projects that I'll be developing, and you can probably link back to through 
my GitHub or other social media.

HO HO HO! Merry Christmas!!
