I went to play airsoft this weekend with some people from my company.
We went to a venue called "Asobiba", which means play place.
In Japan, airsoft is known as サバゲ for survival game, which I actually
didn't realize until about after the end of the games.

It had been a really long time since I had been able to play airsoft,
and I did really badly (lol), but I had a thought during gameplay.

There are often lots of pellets flying really quickly at any spot you
try to rush into and go, and if you don't have any armor, you will
probably literally get welts on your skin where bullets hit you. This
had me thinking that our entire life is a spiritual battleground like
this, and if you don't have any defenses, you're gonna get marred up
BAD. So it had been too long since I read this Scripture, but I
want to leave you with this:

Ephesians 6:11-18, NIV:  
"Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against
the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers
of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the
heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when
the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after
you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of
truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness
in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from
the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of
faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil
one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which
is the word of God.
And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and
requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for
all the Lord's people.

A couple of final takeaways I really just got from typing out that
Scripture are that righteousness is indeed a part of the armor;
I am definitely on-guard against becoming self-righteous and the
last thing I want in my life is to be like a Pharisee and not
practicing what I preach. That said, it is important to actually
be righteous and while not wise in your own eyes, having righteousness.
Also that we should be praying all different kinds of prayers.

Hope this inspires you! Keep up the hard work and keep pushing towards
your goals, and keep working to remove any old/bad thinking and the
voices that keep trying to hold you back.
