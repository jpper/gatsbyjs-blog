I hope this post encourages somebody! I think the analogy of life, especially the Christian one, as a marathon, is a rather accurate one. We are all running a race, and it is not easy. However, if you set yourself a habit of physically running every day, things get easier over time. I've been struggling over the last 5 months or so to get even the most basic job searching app up and running. Getting back into the software development field, and improving my Japanese and programming skills enough to be a little dangerous is coming along, but not very quickly.

However, I think it's so important in life to celebrate the small victories. Rome wasn't built in a day. I'm not going to be able to establish an amazing company in one year. However, if you set little milestones for yourself, and just continue on and celebrate those milestones, you're going to be able to keep yourself moving forward. Also celebrate victories in your spiritual walk! Any area of thinking you used to struggle with before, or have been able to improve. That's all for now; check back for more short posts in the future, keep striving to accomplish your goals, and dream big!!!
