Welcome to 2020!  

I'll just share a bit about my visit back to Michigan and about
my holiday. I enjoyed a nice couple of weeks after having just
started my new job going back to Michigan for the first time in
almost two years. We enjoyed a nice Christmas in Chicago and then
I had plenty of time to catch up with and enjoy with my parents,
brother, cousins, and aunt. I also had the fortunate opportunity
to visit for a while with my grandma, as she is getting quite old
and I want to savor every opportunity that presents itself to
learn from wise people in my life.

I ushered in the new year with a few old friends from college, all of whom
it was great to see again. It was reminiscent of the lot of time I spent
between jobs back in Michigan, and made me realize that I didn't really
miss that situation all that much, and made me really appreciate that I would
be able to get right back into a full-time job. I can't describe how grateful
I am for it, especially since I love the work so much.

My January has held improving a mobile app we're developing for our client,
working on another application based on Cordova, and doing just a little bit
of design work. I'm looking forward to what the future holds, and have a great
feeling this is going to be an amazing year of blessing.
