The mind is a battlefield. However, it is over which you can gain victory. But gaining ground in the battlefield of your mind is a process that goes little by little.

One of the most difficult areas of battle in your mind is shame from the past. This is something 
that I personally believe holds me back from my full potential every day. It stops me from going 
forward and making tough decisions that I believe could be launching me into even more of my 
potential. Regret over this not having launched myself even further can create even further remorse, 
and before you know it, you're in this recursive loop of shame and disappointment.

But luckily, the story doesn't have to end there. The truth is, everyone deals with mental obstacles and difficulty. By very definition, life is a battle and a war most against self. Do we ever truly reach a point of "victory" over our own minds? I surely don't believe so, until the day we get to heaven. But I think that the good practical news is that we actually can make progress.

One of the things I've been toying with in my mind is the fact that if we are indeed making progress,
that means that every day we're alive is the best day of our lives and that basically, the day we
were born was the worst. I still genuinely believe that, but what a wonderful thing it is that we
don't really have to remember most of those early days. But, we do then have responsibility over our
own lives and over our personal progress. Measuring our progress is something I've become relatively
obsessed with lately, but I think the most important thing is that you're going to go far in your
life as long as you're committed to moving forward and not backward, and just putting God first.

Philippians 3:13, ERV
Brothers and sisters, I know that I still have a long way to go. But there is one thing I do: I forget what is in the past and try as hard as I can to reach the goal before me.
